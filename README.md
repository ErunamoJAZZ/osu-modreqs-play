# #modreqs web, for Osu! game

In the past, Osu! had a section in his web to get the last posted maps in #modreqs channel.
For some reason this stops work in 2014: https://osu.ppy.sh/forum/t/211410

This simple app try to emulate a bit this utility.

I hope people (specially _Nominators_), can find it util!!



# Technology
I know it is not a common stack... not many people know Scala.

Its using Play framework for serve pages, SQLite (for now) as Database. IRC connection is just a simple Socket.
I am a bit lazy with web design, poke me if you want to help me with this.
